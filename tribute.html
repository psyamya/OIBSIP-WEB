                Bhagat Singh was an Indian revolutionary and a great freedom fighter who fought against British during the Indian Independence Movement. Many leaders like Mangal Pandey, Siraj ud-Daulah, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal, Bal, Pal and thousands of Indians sacrificed their life to gain Independence from British. Bhagat Singh at a very young age involved himself in various organisations before he died at a very young age of 23years. Following his execution on 31st March 1931, his followers called him as Shaheed (martyr).
